# Alan AI news reading APP built with React
*The app is linked with [Alan AI bot](https://alan.app/).*  
*At the landing page, all you have to do is ask him to read you the news (by surce, term, category, or just the latest).*  
*He will present you with 20 articles. He can read each title and even open it on a new tab for you.*  

# What I have learned building this  

> alan ai interaction via react app   
> material ui Grid, Grow and Typography   
> useStyles / styles.js   
> 'classNames' utility to apply conditional classes in React   
> 'wordsToNumbers' utility to parse unclear spoken words into numbers

## About

* I enjoyed being able to understand a little about interactions with a different platform.  
* I learned to know how the bot navigates through the pages and also how it can scroll to command.  
* Overall it was a great experience and thank a lot to Javascript Mastery for providing the material!.  
* Project status: working

## And here's the usual stuff 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
